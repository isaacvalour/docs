  After logout, the access token becomes invalid and cannot be used for API requests.

## Error Responses

<ResponseExample>

```json Unauthorized
{
  "success": false,
  "message": "Unauthorized",
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "type": "authentication_error",
    "details": "Invalid or expired token"
  }
}
```

</ResponseExample>

## Status Codes

<ResponseField name="200" type="number">
  Logout successful
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="401" type="number">
  Unauthorized - invalid or expired token
</ResponseField>

<ResponseField name="500" type="number">
  Internal server error
</ResponseField>

## Notes

- The access token is immediately invalidated upon successful logout
- Any subsequent requests with the same token will return 401 Unauthorized
- Refresh tokens (if any) are also invalidated
- This is a stateless operation - no server-side session cleanup is required

## Security Considerations

- Always call logout when the user explicitly wants to end their session
- Clear any stored tokens from client-side storage after logout
- Consider implementing automatic logout on token expiration
- For mobile apps, logout should also clear any cached authentication data
