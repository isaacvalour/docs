## Authentication

Valour API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Include your access token in the Authorization header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your_access_token>
```

<Note>
Access tokens expire after 2 hours. Use refresh tokens to obtain new access tokens without requiring user re-authentication.
</Note>

API requests are rate-limited to ensure fair usage and system stability:

- **Authenticated requests**: 1000 requests per hour per user
- **Unauthenticated requests**: 100 requests per hour per IP
- **Webhook endpoints**: 1000 requests per hour per client

<Info>
Rate limit headers are included in all responses:
- `X-RateLimit-Limit`: Maximum requests allowed
- `X-RateLimit-Remaining`: Remaining requests in current window
- `X-RateLimit-Reset`: Time when the rate limit resets
</Info>
