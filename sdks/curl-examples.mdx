## Testing Tips

### Save Responses to Files

<CodeGroup>

```bash Save Response to File
curl -X GET https://api.railsfromthecrypt.com/v1/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -o transactions.json
```

```bash Save Response with Pretty Print
curl -X GET https://api.railsfromthecrypt.com/v1/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  | jq '.' > transactions.json
```

</CodeGroup>

### Verbose Output

<CodeGroup>

```bash Verbose Output
curl -X GET https://api.railsfromthecrypt.com/v1/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -v
```

```bash Include Headers in Output
curl -X GET https://api.railsfromthecrypt.com/v1/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -i
```

</CodeGroup>

### Timeout and Retry

<CodeGroup>

```bash Set Timeout
curl -X GET https://api.railsfromthecrypt.com/v1/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  --max-time 30
```

```bash Retry on Failure
curl -X GET https://api.railsfromthecrypt.com/v1/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  --retry 3 \
  --retry-delay 1
```

</CodeGroup>

## Environment Variables

### Using Environment Variables

<CodeGroup>

```bash Set Environment Variables
export HR_API_BASE_URL="https://api.railsfromthecrypt.com"
export HR_ACCESS_TOKEN="YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
export HR_REFRESH_TOKEN="YOUR_REFRESH_TOKEN"
```

```bash Use Environment Variables
curl -X GET $HR_API_BASE_URL/v1/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $HR_ACCESS_TOKEN"
```

</CodeGroup>

## Common Issues

### Authentication Errors

<CodeGroup>

```bash Check Token Validity
curl -X GET https://api.railsfromthecrypt.com/v1/users/me \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -w "HTTP Status: %{http_code}\n"
```

</CodeGroup>

### Rate Limiting

<CodeGroup>

```bash Check Rate Limit Headers
curl -X GET https://api.railsfromthecrypt.com/v1/transactions \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN" \
  -I
```

</CodeGroup>

### Network Issues

<CodeGroup>

```bash Test Connectivity
curl -X GET https://api.railsfromthecrypt.com/ \
  --connect-timeout 10 \
  --max-time 30
```

</CodeGroup>

## Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Security">
    - Never commit tokens to version control
    - Use environment variables for sensitive data
    - Always use HTTPS endpoints
    - Rotate tokens regularly
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Error Handling">
    - Check HTTP status codes
    - Parse error responses
    - Implement retry logic for 5xx errors
    - Handle rate limiting (429 status)
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Performance">
    - Use appropriate timeouts
    - Implement connection pooling
    - Cache responses when possible
    - Use pagination for large datasets
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Debugging">
    - Use verbose output (-v) for debugging
    - Save responses to files for analysis
    - Check response headers
    - Monitor rate limit headers
  </Accordion>
