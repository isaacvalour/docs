## Welcome to HashRails API

The HashRails API provides a comprehensive suite of financial services including KYC, payments, virtual accounts, and compliance solutions. This documentation covers all available endpoints with detailed examples and response schemas.

## Getting Started

### Authentication

The HashRails API uses two authentication methods:

1. **Bearer Token Authentication**: Include your JWT token in the Authorization header
2. **API Key Authentication**: Include your API key in the X-API-Key header

### Base URLs

- **Production**: `https://api.railsfromthecrypt.com/`
- **Staging**: `https://staging-api.railsfromthecrypt.com/`

### Rate Limiting

API requests are rate limited to ensure fair usage. Rate limits are applied per API key and reset every hour.

### Error Handling

All API responses follow a consistent format. Error responses include detailed error codes and messages to help with debugging.
